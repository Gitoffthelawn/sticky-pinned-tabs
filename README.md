This browser extension forces all links within a pinned tab to open with `target=_blank`. This makes your pinned tabs more "sticky" in that clicking on links won't lose the pinned content.

## Development

Make sure you have Firefox and NodeJS (8 or higher) installed. Start developing like this:

```
npm install
npm start
```
